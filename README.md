# KubernetesShortcuts
let's admit it, Kubernetes is amazing, but writing 'kubectl logs pod -f' is far more annoying than 'klogv'

Prerequires: 
Kubernetes Command line tool (kubectl) 

How to use?
1. Download the folder, if it's in rar/zip, extract it.
2. Move it to desired location, in Windows, add it in the OS disk.
3. Add the folder to Enviroment variable.
Windows:
enter 'Edit the system enviroemnt variables' in Win Search ->
Enviroment Variable -> Path (System or user variable is your own preference) -> Copy Folder url (in my own case it was C:\cli)

now it should work :)
